try Subroutine Instructions 
The CALL instruction copies the address of the next instruction to be fetched on to location SP + 1. It also increments SP by one and transfers control to the instruction specified by the <target_address>. The address of the instruction to be fetched is in IP + 2 (each instruction is 2 memory words). The RET instruction restores the IP value stored at location pointed by SP, decrements SP by one and continues execution fetching the next instruction pointed to by IP. The subroutine instructions provide a neat mechanism for procedure invocations.

CALL
Syntax: CALL <target_address>
Increments SP by 1, transfers IP + 2 to location pointed to by SP and jumps to instruction specified by <target_address>
RET
Syntax: RET
Sets IP to the value pointed to by SP and decrements SP.


only in xsm not in spl

so have to work on it
